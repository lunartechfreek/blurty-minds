## Manual Testing

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

As well as testing on real world devices I wanted to test on other devices that I could not access. For this i used [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). I tested the the website on various mobile and tablet devices, and also various mobile browsers on these devices.

## Bugs

I encountered many bugs throughout my project, the most notable ones are as follows:

- Hide class not working as expected

    ![Hide Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-hide.png)

    - To fix this, I moved my hide class to the bottom of my `.css` file.

- Button font colour displaying as blue.

    ![Font Colour Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-colour.png)

    - To fix this, I added a specific font colour to my `.btn` class.

- How To section displaying incorrectly.

    ![How To Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-how-to.png)

    - To fix this, I added a `min-height` declartion to game box on the stylesheet.

- Image blur distorting area outside of the image.

    ![Image Blur Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-image-blur.png)

    - To fix this, I added the property `overflow: hidden;` to my stylesheet.

- Displayed the end text of the previous question for one second after displaying the new question.

    ![Timer Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-timer.png)

    - To fix this, I added clear interval and the start countdown function to reset, I also added start countdown function to the run game function.

- Correct answer displaying incorrect class on button.

    ![Wrong Answer Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-wrong-answer.png)

    - To fix this, I added `resetButtons()` to the check answer function.

- Timer trying to run multiple times after clicking replay button at game end.

    ![Replay Bug](documentation/TESTING-files/bug-reset.png)

    - To fix this, I updated the restartButton event listener.
