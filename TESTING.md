## Manual Testing

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

As well as testing on real world devices I wanted to test on other devices that I could not access. For this i used [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). I tested the the website on various mobile and tablet devices, and also various mobile browsers on these devices.
