## Introduction

BLURty Minds is a game made for educational purposes for my second portfolio project in software development that I am studying with the Code Institute. This is a challenging game that is aimed for people who want to have some fun and challenge themselves. 

While designing this game I wanted to make it fun but challenging at the same time. I wanted to encourage users to return and play it multiple times so I made two separate sets of questions which vary in difficulty. The game consists of an image that is initially very blurry. Their are four pre-set answer buttons underneath the image and user has 10 seconds to guess what the image is. With every second that passes the image becomes less blurry. To encourage the user to guess the image in a speedy manner, I have designed it so they score more points the faster they answer. If they get an answer wrong they will have five points deducted. The game consists of ten questions but there are more questions available than that for each game. These are shuffled every time to show a random question and encourage the user to return and play again. 

I have applied the the technologies I have learnt so far and used HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to create my game. Other technologies used are listed in the technologies used section further down the page.

## UX

I wanted to design a game that would be displayed clearly on the index page with a clear home section that is easy to navigate. I want to allow for easy navigation to clearly display the different games available and also the how to play section. Once playing I want to set out the game in a way that clearly displays relevant information such as the current game the user is playing and clearly display relevant information such as time remaining, score etc. At the end of the game I wanted to display the users score with a replay button and also a home button for easy navigation back to the home page to change the game.

I wanted to have all of this featured inside the game box to make it clear that throughout the user experience every choice they make is in regards to the game itself. To achieve this I made four sections which are hidden and made visible as the user navigates through the game. Through the use of Javascript enabling me to do this, the game only required one page. 

### Colour Scheme

#### Main Colour Palette

I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to design my main colour palette. I first found a nice vibrant sky blue that I wanted to use as my main colour. I then used the colour generator on the [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) website to help generate other colours that complimented my main chosen colour.

I  chose for my colour scheme to be mainly a selection of blues but with a vibrant aquamarine colour being used to compliment them. I chose these colours to engage the user and to portray a positive emotion that is pleasing to the eye. 

I used a gradient for the background of the page for a nice effect that is pleasing for the users experience. I also did this because I feel the bright colours portray the fun playful side of the game, but I also used a darker cerulean blue which portrays a more serious tone. I feel this is very useful in subconsciously saying to the user this is fun game, but also one that is challenging you to test your brain. 

For the background of the game box I used a ghost white to break up the colours so as to not bombard the user with a visual overload. I also did this to differentiate between the colourful background of the page and the features of the game. I feel this makes the game very clear and helps the user easily identify different elements of the game at first glance.

I wanted to stick with the theme of blue so also used a very dark Oxford blue for the font colour. 

The colours used in my main colour palette are:

* #FCFBFF - Ghost White
* #00D2FC - Aquamarine
* #4FFBDF - Vivid Sky Blue
* #007193 - Cerulean
* #000022 - Oxford Blue

#### Other Colours

I again used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help me achieve this. I started by running the generator until I found a nice green colour. I then removed all of the other of the five default colours so I was left with only two. I then locked in the green and ran the generator until I found a nice red colour than was a good contrast to my chosen green. 

The colours I chose were:

* #OAE240 - Malachite
* #FF3030 - Vermillion

#### Contrast Grid

I used [Contrast Grid Eight Shapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FCFBFF%20%0D%0A%2300D2FC%0D%0A%234FFBDF%0D%0A%23007193%20%0D%0A%23000022%20%0D%0A%230AE240%0D%0A%23FF3030&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check all of my colours for accessibility against each other. I included my correct and incorrect colours in this also.
