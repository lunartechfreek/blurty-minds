## Introduction

BLURty Minds is a game made for educational purposes for my second portfolio project in software development that I am studying with the Code Institute. This is a challenging game that is aimed for people who want to have some fun and challenge themselves. 

While designing this game I wanted to make it fun but challenging at the same time. I wanted to encourage users to return and play it multiple times so I made two separate sets of questions which vary in difficulty. The game consists of an image that is initially very blurry. Their are four pre-set answer buttons underneath the image and user has 10 seconds to guess what the image is. With every second that passes the image becomes less blurry. To encourage the user to guess the image in a speedy manner, I have designed it so they score more points the faster they answer. If they get an answer wrong they will have five points deducted. The game consists of ten questions but there are more questions available than that for each game. These are shuffled every time to show a random question and encourage the user to return and play again. 

I have applied the the technologies I have learnt so far and used HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to create my game. Other technologies used are listed in the technologies used section further down the page.
